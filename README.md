# Moonside for Homebridge

Control your Moonside lamps entirely through HomeKit.  
This plugin talks directly to Moonside’s official Firebase backend, keeps a realtime websocket open for instant updates, and exposes your favorite effects as stateless theme switches.

## Highlights

- 🔌 **Native HomeKit light accessories** – Power, brightness, color (Hue/Sat) and status updates stay in sync with the Moonside app.
- 🔁 **Realtime cloud stream** – Uses the same Firebase SSE channel as the app, so automations respond immediately.
- ✨ **Theme surge strip** – Provide theme names once and every lamp gains a “Lamp – Themes” accessory whose outlets trigger those effects (e.g., “Dancing Ocean”, “Awesome Theme”) and automatically reset after one second.

## Installation

1. Clone/download this repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd Homebridge/homebridge-moonside
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. For development, link it to your local Homebridge:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```
3. Add the platform to your Homebridge `config.json` (or via Config UI X) and restart Homebridge.

## Configuration

```jsonc
{
  "platform": "Moonside",
  "name": "Moonside",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "password": "super-secret",
  "logLevel": "warning",
  "enablePolling": false,
  "pollingInterval": 60,
  "themeSwitches": [
    "Dancing Ocean",
    "Awesome Theme"
  ]
}
```

### Theme switches

- Each name in `themeSwitches` is looked up in Moonside’s effect catalog. When found, the plugin builds a surge-strip accessory named `<Lamp Name> – Themes` with outlets for every requested effect.
- Flipping an outlet sends the corresponding `THEME.<code>` command and resets to “Off” after one second.
- If a name can’t be found, the plugin logs a warning but keeps running.

## Development

- `npm run watch` compiles TypeScript and restarts the bundled Homebridge test harness.
- Set `"logLevel": "debug"` while testing to dump every Firebase payload.
- The Firebase API key lives inside `src/moonsideApi.ts`; if Moonside rotates it, update the constant and rebuild.

## Roadmap

- [x] Cloud discovery + realtime streaming
- [x] Stateless theme switchboard
- [x] Cloud catalog lookup / accessory cleanup
- [ ] LAN / local protocol support
- [ ] Surface community/shared themes
- [ ] Auto-discover favorite/custom themes from the Moonside account

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication errors** – Double-check email/password in the config. The plugin logs when it fails to swap refresh tokens.
- **Theme missing** – Ensure the name exactly matches what the Moonside app shows. Capitalization matters because we match against the cloud catalog.
- **Accessory mismatch** – Delete the stale accessory from HomeKit and restart Homebridge; the plugin re-registers everything automatically.

Enjoy your Moonside lights with full HomeKit automation! If you build new features or crack the local protocol, feel free to open a PR.
